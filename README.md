# CustomerAPIforSPP
case for spp
For some reason the api calls didnt work. I even tried to call it in postman.
Maybe i missed some headers that were supposed to go with it.
Anyway,tried my best to show how i implement rest methods.
Didnt habe time to write somw tests but i would prefer to use wirmeock Junit.
Hopefully this is enough to showcase my experience and get some discussions going during the interview. 
Generating the WSDL file were tricky for me. Put in more work to it than i want to admit:)
